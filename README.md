# Roxygen documentation in Sublime Text 3

I wanted a simple package to automate documentation of R libraries in Sublime Text 3 using [roxygen](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html). I couldn't get [R-Box](https://github.com/randy3k/R-Box) to work, so I just took this function from [Rtools](https://github.com/karthik/Rtools) and turned it into a package that works with ST3.

## Installation

---

Just clone this repo into your `Sublime Text 3/Packages` folder. For me this is located at `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/`.

    git clone git@github.com:explodecomputer/ST3roxygen.git


## Usage

---

To insert documentation, when the cursor is on the function line press `cmd + alt + shift + r`.
